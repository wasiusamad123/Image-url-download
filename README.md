# PHP Image Downloader
This is a simple PHP script that allows you to download an image from a URL and save it to a file on your server. This can be useful if you want to automate the process of downloading images, or if you need to download a large number of images.

Requirements
PHP 5.6 or higher
CURL library
Usage
To use the script, simply modify the $url and $filename variables to match the URL of the image you want to download and the filename you want to save it as, respectively. Then, upload the script to your server and run it.

The script will use CURL to download the image data and save it to the specified file. Once the download is complete, the script will output a message indicating whether the download was successful or not.
